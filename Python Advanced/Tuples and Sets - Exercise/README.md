# Exercise: Tuples and Sets
## 1. Unique Usernames
Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of N usernames and keeps a collection only of the unique ones. On the first line, you will receive an integer N. On the next N lines, you will receive a username. Print the collection on the console (the order does not matter):
#### Examples

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 6<br />George<br />George<br />George<br />Peter<br />George<br />NiceGuy1234 | George <br />Peter<br />NiceGuy1234 |
| 10<br />Peter<br />Maria<br />Peter<br />George<br />Steve<br />Maria<br />Alex<br />Peter<br />Steve<br />George | Peter<br />Maria<br />George<br />Steve<br />Alex |

## 2. Sets of Elements
Write a program that prints a set of elements. On the first line, you will receive two numbers - n and m, separated by a single space - representing the lengths of two separate sets. On the next n + m lines, you will receive n numbers, which are the numbers in the first set, and m numbers, which are in the second set. Find all the unique elements that appear in both and print them on separate lines (the order does not matter).  
For example:  
Set with length n = 4: {1, 3, 5, 7}  
Set with length m = 3: {3, 4, 5}  
Set that contains all the elements that repeat in both sets -> {3, 5}
