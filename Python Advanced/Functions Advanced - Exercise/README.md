# Exercise: Functions Advanced

## 1. Negative vs Positive
You will receive a sequence of numbers (integers) separated by a single space. Separate the negative numbers from  
the positive. Find the total sum of the negatives and positives, and print the following:  
* On the first line, print the sum of the negatives
* On the second line, print the sum of the positives
* On the third line:
    * If the absolute negative number is larger than the positive number:
"The negatives are stronger than the positives"  
    * If the positive number is larger than the absolute negative number:
"The positives are stronger than the negatives"  
Note: you will not receive any zeroes in the input.  
#### Example

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 1 2 -3 -4 65 -98 12 57 -84 | -189<br />137<br />The negatives are stronger than the positives |
| 1 2 3 | 0<br />6<br />The positives are stronger than the negatives |

## 2. Keyword Arguments Length
Create a function called kwargs_length() that can receive some keyword arguments and return their length.  
Submit only your function in the judge system.  
#### Examples

| Test Code | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| dictionary = {'name': 'Peter', 'age': 25}<br />print(kwargs_length(**dictionary)) | 2 |
| dictionary = {}<br />print(kwargs_length(**dictionary)) | 0 |

## 3. Even or Odd
Create a function called even_odd() that can receive a different quantity of numbers and a command at the end. The command can be "even" or "odd". Filter the numbers depending on the command and return them in a list.  
Submit only your function in the judge system.  
#### Examples

| Test Code | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| print(even_odd(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, "even")) | [2, 4, 6] |
| print(even_odd(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, "odd")) | [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] |

## 4. Numbers Filter
Create a function called even_odd_filter() that can receive a different number of named arguments. The keys will be "even" and/or "odd", and the values will be a list of numbers.When the key is "odd", you should extract only the odd numbers from its list. When the key is "even", you should extract only the even numbers from its list. The function should return a dictionary sorted by the length of the lists in descending order. There will be no case of lists with the same length.  
Submit only your function in the judge system.  
#### Example

## 5. Concatenate
Write a concatenate() function that receives some strings as arguments and some named arguments (the key will be a string, and the value will be another string). First, you should concatenate all arguments successively. Next, take each key successively, and if it is present in the resulting string, change all matching parts with the key's value. In the end, return the final string. See the examples for more clarification.  
Submit only your function in the judge system.
#### Examples

## 6. Function Executor
Create a function called func_executor() that can receive a different number of tuples, each of which will have exactly 2 elements: the first will be a function, and the second will be a tuple of the arguments that need to be passed to that function. You should execute each function and return its result in the format:  
"{function name} - {function result}"   
For more clarification, see the examples below.  
Submit only your function in the judge system.  
#### Examples

| `def make_upper(*strings):` <br />`    result = tuple(s.upper() for s in strings)` <br />`    return result`<br />`def make_lower(*strings):`<br />`    result = tuple(s.lower() for s in strings)`<br />`    return result`<br />`print(func_executor((make_upper, ("Python", "softUni")), (make_lower, ("PyThOn",)),))`  | make_upper - ('PYTHON', 'SOFTUNI')<br />make_lower - ('python', ) |

## 7. Grocery
Create a function called grocery_store() that receives a different number of key-value pairs. The key will be the product's name and the value - its quantity. You should return a sorted receipt for all products. They should be sorted by their quantity in descending order. If there are two or more products with the same quantity, sort them by their name's length in descending order. If there are two or more products with the same name's length, sort them by their name in ascending order (alphabetically). In the end, return a string in the following format:  
"{product_name1}: {product_quantity1}  
{product_name2}: {product_quantity2}  
â€¦  
{product_nameN}: {product_quantityN}"  
#### Examples

| Test Code | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| print(grocery_store(bread=5, pasta=12, eggs=12,)) | pasta: 12<br />eggs: 12<br />bread: 5 |
| print(grocery_store(bread=2, pasta=2, eggs=20, carrot=1,)) | eggs: 20<br />bread: 2<br />pasta: 2<br />carrot: 1 |

## 8. Age Assignment
Create a function called age_assignment() that receives a different number of names and a different number of key-value pairs. The key will be a single letter (the first letter of each name) and the value - a number (age). Find its first letter in the key-value pairs for each name and assign the age to the person's name.  
Then, sort the names in ascending order (alphabetically) and return the information for each person on a new line in the format: "{name} is {age} years old."  
Submit only the function in the judge system.  
#### Examples

| Test Code | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| print(age_assignment("Peter", "George", G=26, P=19)) | George is 26 years old.<br />Peter is 19 years old. |
| print(age_assignment("Amy", "Bill", "Willy", W=36, A=22, B=61)) | Amy is 22 years old.<br />Bill is 61 years old.<br />Willy is 36 years old. |

9. Recursion Palindrome
Write a recursive function called palindrome() that will receive a word and an index (always 0). Implement the function, so it returns "{word} is a palindrome" if the word is a palindrome and "{word} is not a palindrome" if the word is not a palindrome using recursion. Submit only the function in the judge system.
#### Examples

| Test Code | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| print(palindrome("abcba", 0)) | abcba is a palindrome |
| print(palindrome("peter", 0)) | peter is not a palindrome |

10. \*Fill the Box
Write a function called fill_the_box that receives a different number of arguments representing:  
* the height of a box
* the length of a box
* the width of a box
* different numbers - each representing the quantity of cubes. Each cube has an exact size of 1 x 1 x 1
* a string "Finish"
Your task is to fill the box with the given cubes until the current argument equals "Finish".  
Note: Submit only the function in the judge system  
#### Input
* There will be no input. Just parameters passed to your function.
#### Output
The function should return a string in the following format:  
* If, in the end, there is free space left in the box, print:
    * "There is free space in the box. You could put {free space in cubes} more cubes."
* If there is no free space in the box, print:
    * "No more free space! You have {cubes left} more cubes."
#### Examples

| Test Code | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| print(fill_the_box(2, 8, 2, 2, 1, 7, 3, 1, 5, "Finish")) | There is free space in the box. You could put 13 more cubes. |
| print(fill_the_box(5, 5, 2, 40, 11, 7, 3, 1, 5, "Finish")) | No more free space! You have 17 more cubes. |
| print(fill_the_box(10, 10, 10, 40, "Finish", 2, 15, 30)) | There is free space in the box. You could put 960 more cubes. |

11. \*Math Operations
Write a function named math_operations that receives a different number of floats as arguments and 4 keyword arguments. The keys will be single letters: "a", "s", "d", "m", and the values will be numbers. You need to take each float argument from the sequence and do mathematical operations as follows:  
* The first element should be added to the value of the key "a"
* The second element should be subtracted from the value of the key "s"
* The third element should be divisor to the value of the key "d"
* The fourth element should be multiplied by the value of the key "m"
* Each result should replace the value of the corresponding key
* You must repeat the same steps consecutively until you run out of numbers
Beware: You cannot divide by 0. If the operation could throw an error, you should skip the operation and continue
to the next one.
After you finish calculating all numbers, sort the four elements by their values in descending order. If two or more
values are equal, sort them by their keys in ascending order (alphabetically).
In the end, return each key-value pair in the format "{key}: {value}" on separate lines. Each value should be
formatted to the first decimal point.
For more clarifications, see the examples below.
Note: Submit only the function in the judge system
