## 1. Negative vs Positive
You will receive a sequence of numbers (integers) separated by a single space. Separate the negative numbers from  
the positive. Find the total sum of the negatives and positives, and print the following:  
* On the first line, print the sum of the negatives
* On the second line, print the sum of the positives
* On the third line:
    * If the absolute negative number is larger than the positive number:
"The negatives are stronger than the positives"  
    * If the positive number is larger than the absolute negative number:
"The positives are stronger than the negatives"  
Note: you will not receive any zeroes in the input.
