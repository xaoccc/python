# More Exercises: Lists Advanced

## 1.	Social Distribution

A core idea of several left-wing ideologies is that the wealthiest should support the poorest, no matter what, and that is exactly what you are called to do for this problem.  
On the first line, you will be given the population (numbers separated by comma and space ", "). On the second line, you will be given the minimum wealth. 
You should distribute the wealth so that no part of the population has less than the minimum wealth. To do that, you should always take wealth from the wealthiest part of the population.   
There will be cases where the distribution will not be possible. In that case, print: "No equal distribution possible".  

#### Example

| Input  | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 2, 3, 5, 15, 75, 5<br />5  | [5, 5, 5, 15, 70] |
| 2, 3, 5, 15, 75<br />20  | [20, 20, 20, 20, 20] |
| 2, 3, 5, 45, 45<br />30  | No equal distribution possible |

## 2.	Take/Skip Rope

Write a program, which reads a string and skips through it, extracting a hidden message. The algorithm you should implement is as follows:  
Let us take the string "skipTest_String044160" as an example.  
Take every digit from the string and transfer it somewhere. After this operation, you should have two lists of items - a numbers list and a non-numbers list:  
*	Numbers' list: [0, 4, 4, 1, 6, 0]
*	Non-numbers: [s, k, i, p, T, e, s, t, _, S, t, r, i, n, g]
After that, take every digit in the numbers list and split it up into a take list and a skip list. In the take list, you should keep all digits at an even index. In the skip list, you should keep all digits at an odd index.
*	Numbers' list: [0, 4, 4, 1, 6, 0]
*	Take list: [0, 4, 6]
*	Skip list: [4, 1, 0]
Afterward, iterate over both lists:
*	First, take m characters from the non-numbers list and store it in a result string
*	Then, skip n characters from the non-numbers list
Note that the skipped characters are summed up as they go. The process would look like this:  
1.	Current string: "skipTest_String". Take 0 characters and skip 4 characters: 
     *	Taken string: ""
     *	Skipped string: "skip"
2.	The remaining string looks like this: "Test_String". Take 4 characters and skip 1 character:
     *	Taken string: "Test"
     *	Skipped string: "_"
3.	The string looks like this: "String". Take 6 characters and skip 0 characters:
     *	Taken string: "String"
     *	Skipped string: ""
4.	The final string is "TestString".
After that, print the final string on the console.  

#### Constraints

*	The count of digits in the input string will always be even.
*	The encrypted message will contain any printable ASCII character.

## 3.	Kate's Way Out

Kate is stuck in a maze. You should help her to find her way out.  
On the first line, you will be given how many rows there are in the maze. On the following n lines, you will be given the maze itself. Here is a legend for the maze:  
*	"#" - means a wall; Kate cannot go through there
*	" " - means empty space; Kate can go through there
*	"k" - the initial position of Kate; start looking for a way out from there
There are two options: Kate either gets out or not:
*	If Kate can get out, print the following: 
"Kate got out in {number_of_moves} moves". 
Note: If there are two or more ways out, she always chooses the longest one.
*	Otherwise, print: "Kate cannot get out".

#### Examples

| Input  | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 4<br />######<br />##  k#<br />## ###<br />## ###  | Kate got out in 5 moves |
| 5<br />######<br />##  k#<br />## ###<br />######<br />## ### | Kate cannot get out |

## 4.	Battle Ships

You will be given a number n representing the number of rows of the field. On the following n lines, you will receive each field row as a string with numbers separated by a space. Each number greater than zero represents a ship with health equal to the number value.  
After that, you will receive the squares that are being attacked in the format: "{row}-{col} {row}-{col}". Each time a square is being attacked, if there is a ship (number greater than 0), you should reduce its value by 1. If a ship's health reaches zero, it is destroyed. After the attacks have ended, print how many ships were destroyed. 

#### Example

| Input  | Output | Comment |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 3<br />1 0 0 1<br />2 0 0 0<br />0 3 0 1<br />0-0 1-0 2-1 2-1 2-1 1-1 2-1  | 2 | States after each attack:<br />First attack -> 1 ship destroyed<br />0 0 0 1<br />2 0 0 0<br />0 3 0 1<br />Second attack -> reduce ship health<br />0 0 0 1<br />1 0 0 0<br />0 2 0 1<br />Third attack -> reduce ship health<br />0 0 0 1<br />2 0 0 0<br />0 2 0 1<br />Fourth attack -> reduce ship health<br />0 0 0 1<br />2 0 0 0<br />0 1 0 1<br />Fifth attack -> another ship destroyed<br />0 0 0 1<br />2 0 0 0<br />0 0 0 1<br />Sixth and Seventh attack -> no ship destroyed |
| 5<br />1 0 5 0 1<br />6 3 9 0 0<br />7 9 4 3 2<br />1 0 0 4 9<br />5 6 0 3 5<br />0-1 0-2 0-2 0-2 0-2 0-2 3-0 | 2 |  |

## 5.	Dots

You will be given a number n representing the number of rows of a board of dots and dashes. On the following n lines, you will receive each row of the board as a string with symbols (dots and dashes only), separated by a single space.  
Your task is to find and print the largest count of dots that could be connected at once. You could only connect horizontally or vertically.
