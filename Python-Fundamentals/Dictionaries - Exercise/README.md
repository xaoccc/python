## 2.	A Miner Task
You will be given a sequence of strings, each on a new line until you receive the "stop" command. Every odd line on the console represents a resource (e.g., Gold, Silver, Copper, and so on) and every even - quantity. Your task is to collect the resources and print them each on a new line.

The quantities will be in the range \[1 â€¦ 2 000 000 000\].
