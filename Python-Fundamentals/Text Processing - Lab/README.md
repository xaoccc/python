# Lab: Text Processing
## 1.	Reverse Strings
You will be given strings on separate lines until you receive an "end" command. Write a program that reverses strings and prints each pair on a separate line in the format "{word} = {reversed_word}".
#### Examples

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| helLo<br />Softuni<br />bottle<br />end | helLo = oLleh<br />Softuni = inutfoS<br />bottle = elttob |
| Dog<br />caT<br />chAir<br />end | Dog = goD<br />caT = Tac<br />chAir = riAhc |

## 2.	Repeat Strings
Write a program that reads a sequence of strings, separated by a single space. Each string should be repeated N times, where N is the length of the string. Print the final strings concatenated into one string.
#### Examples

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| hi abc add | hihiabcabcabcaddaddadd |
| work | workworkworkwork |
| ball | ballballballball |
