Notes about binary trees:
1. Each node  in a binary tree can have up to 2 children, otherwise is becomes a graph
2. Left child is always smaller than right child\
3. A Node is a tree
4. Define a tree  
`class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
   
        self.left = None
   
        self.right = None
   
        self.data = data`
